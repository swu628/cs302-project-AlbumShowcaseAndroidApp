# Album showcase android app

## Introduction of team
This project is completed by Helen Huang and Kylyn Wu at June 4, 2023.

## Introduction to our app
Our Android application is capable of categorising and displaying albums to be sold, allow users 
to search for albums they desire and save any albums of interest. 

## Design rationale
Our team has chosen green as the primary colour for our Android application, as it symbolises 
vitality, hope, and peace. We believe that K-Pop music embodies these qualities and gives its 
audiences a similar positive vibe. The shade of green weâ€™ve used is a gentle, warmish green with 
more yellow tones and fewer blue tones. This is due to the fact that our intended audience will 
be a younger demographic as they are most likely to be interested in K-pop. Also, we wish to 
promote energy and vitality to users.

## Notice
If there is an error in the SplashActivity and ListActivity java class, try to modify this line 
of code: implementation "com.airbnb.android:lottie:lottieVersion", which appears inside the 
build.gradle (Module.app) file. Replace lottieVersion with the latest available or to the version 
where no error will occur in your local computer.
